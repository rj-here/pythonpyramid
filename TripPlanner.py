#This program is supposed to help you plan a trip. This will feature many parts, and is partly inspired by my personal trip planning template.
#This is just a quick and basic way for you to note down your ideas, which you can then use to plan out further. I currently do not plan to expand this, but I may consider in the future.
#This is part of a growing collection of Python programs, for me to get a proper grasp of basics, and for you to see.
